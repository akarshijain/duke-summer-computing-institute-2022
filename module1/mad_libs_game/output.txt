Once upon a time there was a [ animal ].  The [ 0 ] lived in a very scary [ place ].
One day, the [ 0 ] left his [ 2 ] and went in search of a [ food ].  
The [ 0 ] wandered for [ time ] and finally reached a [ place ].
In that [ 8 ] the [ 0 ] encountered a [ magiccreature ] with a [ thing ].
[ greeting ]! [ said ] the [ 11 ].  What brings you to my [ 8 ], the [ 11 ] asked
waving his [ 12 ] towards the [ 0 ].
I left my [ 2 ] in search of a [ 5 ] because I was hungry and my [ 2 ] is
quite a scary place.  Do you have any [ 5 ] here the [ 0 ] [ said ]?
Why it just so happens that I do have one the [ 11 ] [ 14 ].  However,
I will only share it with you if you help me fix my [ 12 ], which
is not quite working right at the moment.   Oh [ 12 ] repair [ said ]
the [ 0 ]?  Why that is my area of expertise.  Let me take a look
at your [ 12 ].  The [ 11 ] handed his [ 12 ] to the [ 0 ], who promptly
fixed it, and was rewarded with a [ 5 ].   The [ 0 ] and [ 11 ] became
best friends and lived happily ever after in the [ 8 ].

The end.
