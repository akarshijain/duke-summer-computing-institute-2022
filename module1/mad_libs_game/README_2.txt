In the previous assignment, you read the story template and found the blanks.
For this assignment, you should start by copying the code that you used for the previous
assignment (remember the "cp" command?).

You should then modify it so that each time you find a blank, you determine whether it is
a word blank or a numeric blank.  You should then include either "word" or "num" in
information you add to the string for that blank, such as

  "The [ word animal ] went to the [ word place ].  Then the [ num 0 ] ate the [ word food ]."

We have give you an output.txt which is what your program should print when you
run the above main code.
