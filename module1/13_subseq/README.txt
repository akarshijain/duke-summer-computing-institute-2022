 1. Create a file called subseq.py and write the function:
      maxSeq(list)
    which returns the length of the maximum increasing contiguous
    subsequence in the list. For example, if the list passed in were
      [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 8, 2, 4, 6, 9]
    this function would return 4 because the longest sequence of
    (strictly) increasing numbers in that array is 1, 3, 5, 8, which
    has length 4.  Note that 1, 3, 5, 8, 9 is an increasing
    subsequence, but is not contiguous.

    Note that the subsequence just needs to be increasing, not
    increasing by any particular pattern or rate. 

 2. Run and test your code using the test-subseq.py you wrote
    previously.  You can copy or symlink that file into this directory,
    then execute the code in test-subseq.py

 3. Submit your code for subseq.py
     
Hint: Can you abstract a complex step out into a simple function?
